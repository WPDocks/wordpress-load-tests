Load tests for Wordpress ðŸ§ª

#### Local testing
The recomended way of testing is to run the containers dedicated for storage and visualization (grafana & influx) via
docker-compose and to test with your local machine (since via docker you can have some limitations, like ulimits).

```
docker-compose up -d influx grafana
CASES_URL=https://test.loadimpact.com/ CASES_VUs=1000 CASES_DURATION=300s k6 run --out influxdb=http://localhost:8086/k6 tests/main.js
```

If you want to run the tests via docker:
```
docker-compose run k6
```
